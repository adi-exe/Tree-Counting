# Automated Tree Enumeration 


When people want to use parts of a forest for building things like roads or buildings, it's important to know how many trees are in that area. Normally, people count the trees by walking around and looking, but that takes a lot of time, money, and can be wrong sometimes.

To fix this problem, the challenge is to create a smart computer program that looks at pictures taken from satellites or airplanes. This program should be able to figure out how many trees there are and what kinds they are. It's like a tree detective!

Here are the important things this program needs to do:

Look at Pictures: Make a special computer program that can study pictures taken from space or airplanes. It needs to be really good at spotting trees, even if they look different because of their size, shape, or where they are.

Count and Sort Trees: Create a system that can count how many trees are in a certain spot and figure out what types they are, like different kinds of trees or how big around they are.

Check if it's Right: Make sure the computer program's answers are correct by comparing them to information from people who walked around and counted trees the normal way. This helps us trust that the computer program is doing a good job.

Work Quickly: Build the program so it can look at lots of pictures in a short time. This is important when we need to look at really big forests or when we're in a hurry.

Fit with Other Tools: Make sure the computer program can easily work with other computer programs that manage forests. It can show the information it finds in ways that people can understand, like maps or reports.

Be Ethical and Safe: Make sure the program follows the rules, keeps people's information private, and doesn't harm the environment. It should be respectful and not cause problems.




By doing all these things, this smart computer program will help us quickly and correctly count the trees in a forest when we want to use the land for something else. This helps us make smart choices about the environment and keeps things fair for everyone.

# IMPORTANT NOTE:-
When people want to use parts of a forest for building things like roads or buildings, they need to know how many trees are there. But counting trees manually takes a lot of time and can be wrong. So, we want to make a computer program that looks at pictures of the forest from above (like from a plane) to count the trees and figure out what kinds they are.

The program needs to be smart. It should understand different types of trees, how big they are, and where they're growing. It should also be really good at getting the right answers. Here's what our program will do:

Look at Pictures: It will use special computer vision magic to study pictures taken from above. It will learn how to tell trees apart from other things.

Count Trees: The program will count how many trees are in a certain spot.

Sort Trees: It will also group the trees by their types, like oak trees or pine trees, and measure how wide around they are.

Check if it's Right: We'll make sure the program's answers are correct by comparing them to information from people who counted trees on the ground.

Work Fast: The program will be quick at looking at lots of pictures so we can count trees in big areas without waiting forever.

Show Results: It will be friendly and show the tree counts and types in ways that people can understand, like on a map or a report.

Be Good and Safe: We promise to keep people's information private and follow the rules about taking care of the environment.

With our smart computer program, we'll make sure that when forests are used for projects, like building roads, we do it responsibly and keep the right balance between development and taking care of nature.
